## Application
- **MongoDB** stores user account information and persists sessions (so that a server crash does not log out all users.)
- **Express** functions Node.js middleware to handle all HTTP requests and routing.
- **Angular** handles HTML templating and data manipulation.
- **Node.js** is the runtime for the application.

There is also generous commenting throughout the application which helps explain critical parts of the application.
